# Refactory: Multi-Agent Code Analysis System

## Project Overview

Refactory is a multi-agent system built with PydanticAI that performs comprehensive code reviews by simulating a senior engineering team. The system analyzes code files and provides scored feedback (0-100) with specific recommendations for improvement.

## Architecture

### Core Concept

The system employs five specialized AI agents, each focusing on specific aspects of code quality. These agents work independently and then collaborate to provide unified, actionable feedback.

### Five Specialized Agents

#### 1. Architect Agent
- **Focus**: Design patterns, code structure, SOLID principles
- **Key Questions**: 
  - How can I make this code more maintainable?
  - How can I make it easier to extend?
  - How can this be better engineered?
- **Scoring Areas**: Design quality, modularity, architecture adherence

#### 2. Security Agent
- **Focus**: Vulnerabilities, data protection, secure coding practices
- **Key Questions**:
  - How can I make this code more secure?
  - How can I improve maintainability from a security perspective?
- **Scoring Areas**: Vulnerability risk, data protection, security best practices

#### 3. Performance Agent
- **Focus**: Algorithmic efficiency, resource usage, scalability
- **Key Questions**:
  - How can I make this code more efficient?
  - How can I reduce complexity?
  - How can this be better engineered for performance?
- **Scoring Areas**: Time complexity, memory efficiency, scalability potential

#### 4. Documentation Agent
- **Focus**: Code clarity, comments, API documentation
- **Key Questions**:
  - How can I make this code better documented?
  - How can I make it easier to use?
  - How can I improve maintainability through documentation?
- **Scoring Areas**: Documentation coverage, comment quality, API clarity

#### 5. Style Agent
- **Focus**: Consistency, naming conventions, formatting standards
- **Key Questions**:
  - How can I make this code more consistent?
  - How can I make interfaces easier to use?
  - How can I simplify with clear patterns?
- **Scoring Areas**: Style consistency, naming quality, formatting adherence

## System Workflow

### 1. Input Processing
- Accept individual files or entire repositories
- Support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go)
- Parse code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for structural analysis
- Distribute code sections to relevant agents based on content and language

### 2. Agent Analysis Phase
Each agent independently performs:
- Code analysis from their specialized perspective
- Generation of 0-100 scores for their domain areas
- Identification of specific issues with severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Provision of concrete recommendations with before/after code examples
- Estimation of effort required for implementing fixes

### 3. Coordination Phase
Agents collaborate to:
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Address contradictory recommendations (e.g., performance optimization vs readability)
- **Prioritize Issues**: Rank all recommendations by impact and implementation effort
- **Cross-Reference**: Identify how fixes in one area affect other areas
- **Synthesize Results**: Create unified action plan with clear next steps

### 4. Output Generation
Produce comprehensive review report with structured findings

## Output Structure

### Comprehensive Review Report
- **Overall Score**: Composite 0-100 rating across all dimensions
- **Agent Breakdown**: Individual scores and findings from each agent
- **Priority Issues**: Top recommendations ranked by impact
- **Conflict Resolutions**: Documentation of how competing recommendations were resolved
- **Action Plan**: Step-by-step improvement roadmap
- **Effort Estimates**: Time/complexity estimates for implementing changes

### Scoring Methodology
- **90-100**: Exceptional - Industry best practices, exemplary code
- **80-89**: Good - Solid implementation, minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Acceptable - Functional but has notable issues to address
- **60-69**: Needs Work - Significant improvements required
- **50-59**: Poor - Major problems that should be addressed soon
- **0-49**: Critical - Serious issues requiring immediate attention

## Key Features

### Multi-Language Support
- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go
- Language-specific best practices and conventions
- Framework-aware analysis (React, Django, Flask, Spring, etc.)

### Context-Aware Analysis
- Considers project type (web application, library, CLI tool, microservice, etc.)
- Adapts recommendations based on codebase size and team structure
- Accounts for legacy code constraints vs greenfield projects

### Intelligent Conflict Resolution
- Negotiates solutions when agents disagree (e.g., security vs performance trade-offs)
- Provides trade-off analysis for competing recommendations
- Suggests compromise approaches when possible

### Integration Ready
- CLI tool for local development workflows
- GitHub Action for CI/CD integration
- REST API endpoints for custom integrations
- Multiple export formats (JSON, Markdown, PDF reports)

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: PydanticAI for agent orchestration and communication
- **Code Analysis**: Tree-sitter or language-specific parsers for AST generation
- **Output**: Structured Pydantic models with validation
- **File Support**: Single files, directories, or Git repositories
- **Storage**: Optional caching layer for analysis results

### Agent Communication
- Shared context object containing code analysis and findings
- Message passing system for conflict resolution discussions
- Voting mechanism for final recommendation prioritization
- Comprehensive audit trail of agent decision-making process

### Performance Considerations
- Parallel agent execution for large codebases
- Incremental analysis for changed files only (Git integration)
- Intelligent caching of analysis results to avoid re-processing
- Configurable analysis depth (quick scan vs thorough review)
- Memory-efficient processing for large repositories

## Success Criteria

### Quality Metrics
- Provides actionable, specific recommendations with clear code examples
- Maintains consistency in scoring across similar code patterns
- Generates reports that help developers improve code quality systematically

### Reliability
- Handles edge cases gracefully with informative error messages
- Scales efficiently from single files to large repositories (1000+ files)
- Maintains performance under various codebase conditions

### Usability
- Clear, actionable output that developers can immediately implement
- Integration with existing development workflows
- Configurable analysis depth and focus areas

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up PydanticAI framework and basic agent structure
2. Implement Python language support with Tree-sitter parsing
3. Create basic agent coordination and communication system
4. Develop initial scoring and reporting mechanisms

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement all five specialized agents with domain-specific analysis
2. Add conflict resolution and recommendation prioritization
3. Create comprehensive output formatting and reporting
4. Add CLI interface for local usage

### Phase 3: Extended Support

## Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when language parsers fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging agent interactions
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported code patterns

### Security
- Secure handling of uploaded code repositories
- No execution of analyzed code for safety
- Audit trails for all analysis activities

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for adding new agents
- Configurable analysis rules and scoring weights
- Support for custom coding standards and style guides
